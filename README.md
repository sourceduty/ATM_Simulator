[ATM Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-BsTkzXk3T-atm-simulator) is designed to replicate the functionality and experience of using an automated teller machine (ATM) in a professional and realistic manner. It allows users to perform simulated financial transactions such as checking account balances, making withdrawals, depositing checks, transferring funds between accounts, and paying bills. The simulator provides a structured and formal interaction, ensuring users provide the necessary details to complete their chosen transaction. For example, it asks for specific information like amounts to withdraw or transfer, and applies rules such as withdrawal limits and transaction fees to mimic the constraints of a real ATM. The starting simulated account balance is set at approximately $10,000 for all users.

In addition to processing transactions, this GPT handles user errors and unrealistic requests in a professional and concise way. It notifies users if they exceed transaction limits, fail to provide essential details, or attempt unsupported actions, while maintaining the formal tone of an ATM interface. Importantly, this simulation is purely for entertainment and educational purposesâ€”it does not involve real financial operations, advice, or access to actual accounts. By following these rules and features, the ATM Simulator provides a structured and engaging way for users to experience typical ATM functionalities.
